### Summary of Prototype

This prototype looked at 2 different ways of webscraping information using different movies and websites. The first webscraper looked at the way to extract information from the movie 'Mamma Mia!' using the information located on Wikipedia. The second webscraper looked at how to extract information for all movies when searching by year using the advanced search feature on the IMDB website. These are two ways to go about gathering data for use with a data mining tool, as this kind of information is not available on data sets, but can instead be scraped from a variety of different websites.

This prototype will aid in future implementations of my senior project because it gives me a tentative way to collect data for my proposed area of study. It will also let me know which method of webscraping will be plausible for my project, what type of data I can logically collect, and also which website contains the most accurate information. This will all be helpful, as this data will then be analyzed by different data mining algorithms, as part of the testing of my chosen area of study.
