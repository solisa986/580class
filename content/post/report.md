The area of research in Computer Science that I will be looking into is data analytics. My specific proposed idea is determining whether movie ratings can accurately predict the success of a movie when compared to their budget and profit. This idea is important to the movie industry, as it could potentially serve as a marketing tool, where businesses would be able to know how to promote new movies based on their target users' demographic, age group, income level, and other important factors. This will allow them to know how to maximize their marketing budget, which could potentially lead to more profit. For movie-based platforms that feature a wide variety of users, this could also allow these users to have access to more curated and customized movie trailers/ads.

Though most of my preliminary work focused on what kind of data analysis tool could be used for statistical and sentiment analysis, I decided to continue this research once my specific area of study was found. I instead started focusing on looking into different kinds of industries and concepts that could potentially have a problem area that I could address, which is where I honed in on the movie industry. As this industry appeals to a wide demographic of people but also features the least amount of custom content, then I was able to pinpoint many problem areas that could be explored, especially with the data available about movies. What is already known about this problem area is not usually contained in one singular website, which made preliminary data analysis difficult to perform. However, through the web scraping of multiple websites, of which I will elaborate further later on, I was able to find a data management company that contained access to all of the information I would need for data analysis. As this information was restricted unless authorization was granted, I submitted a request for access and was able to get my access to this data approved for about 1900 movies. This amount of movies should be enough for me to start gauging the problem areas outlined in this industry. The main concentration of my project lies within the unknown factors that can influence a movie's success, where I intend to use different types of data mining and data analysis to research how these factors affect different aspects of a movie. My goals for this project are to get the new 'OpusData' provided to me for movies, clean up the data, and start implementing the use of data analysis tools.

There is a big gap between the movie marketing field and the knowledge of what their clientele will like. This gap is present because there is not a lot of research dedicated towards creating marketing strategies that are geared toward specific users. The implications of this gap could be movies 'flopping' more frequently, which detrimentally affects the profits generated by the movie industry. My solution to this knowledge gap would be to ensure the successfulness of movies because of to there being able to be more targeted marketing. In relation to this gap, I decided to start developing my research question that motivates my project, which is as follows: 'can reviews accurately predict the future success of movie?'.

The scope of this work is mainly just about gathering the new movie data from OpusData and re-sorting it into the correct format that I will need for my data analytics tools. In my personal opinion, I feel that there is feasibility of working on and finishing this project by the proposed timeframe, as I essentially already have all the data I would need to start the analysis process. All that is left now is to sort through the data and to get the data ready for data analysis tools. Potential limits in my area of research could deal with how I could start gathering data from social media so that I could look into the sentimental analysis of movies, as this could lead into an ethics/privacy issue. Some ethical concerns I could see is whether the information presented on social media infringes on the use of private data for a professional research capacity without consent. In preparation for this issue, I plan on researching possible solutions and also reaching out to professional contacts for future guidance. I intend to follow this research as far as I can so that I can get the most accurate analysis that I can. This will ensure that I am able to create the most efficient 'movie-prediction' tool.

I would like to preface the topic of my prototype to state that my initial tool was meant to gather the data that I would need regarding the movies, as I had not been granted access to the 'OpusData' data set at this point in time. Therefore, the prototype I developed shows an introductory way that I would go about obtaining movie data for data analysis. This included gathering information for the first 250 movies of IMDB and saving the information inside of an automatically generated data set. As I needed to be able to test the validity of the results, I decided to hardcode the date range to that of 2017. My prototype is designed to scrape the name of the movie, the year of it's release, the number of user votes, box office earnings, the average score given by critics, and the average rating given by IMDB users. This information is critical to my research, as it is the data that I will need to judge the success/failure of a movie. This is done through the BeautifulSoup Python package, which allows Python users to gather information from websites. To make the data easier to work with, I saved the contents of the web scraping into a pandas data frame. Once this data has been saved, I realized that the scores for metacritic ratings and user ratings were not the same. Therefore, I created another function that would convert the scraped numerical data into the same rating scale. Once this properly converts the 'metacritic ratings' and 'IMDB ratings' into the same scoring, I will then be able to start comparing this information with the estimated budget for the movie. As high budgets are oftentimes given to movies that are predicted to have a higher amount of success (the profit will drastically exceed the budget), I figured that this will be an accurate way of showing whether there is variability on the actual movie success between the two sectors of users (public users and critic users). All this data was scraped from IMDB for a very brief manual analysis of the two ratings, but pandas dataframe and BeautifulSoup was used for the scraping of the data and the presentation of the data.

As my project relies on movie data in order for the analysis of the data to be done, then this prototype demonstrates a way for me to obtain the data needed. It also provides a preliminary way for me to go about analyzing the data, of which I will be able to do in a higher capacity with a data analysis tool. This prototype is what led me to the OpusData access that I was granted, which is what contains all of the remaining information that is needed to go ahead and start sifting through the data for the start of my analysis. The data analysis tool that I have looked into extensively is WEKA, which is a GUI-based data mining software designed to allow for different kinds of data analysis algorithms to be ran against different kinds of data. As I already have some familiarity with the software due to previous research on it, as well as having multiple resources towards this tool, then I believe that this mining tool will be able to be used upon the start of this project.

In order to prove variability between movie reviews and the movie budgets, I decided to run some experiments using a more modified version of my prototype tool. My experiment involved gathering different movie data's according to the different year ranges (as specified by the user) to see how critic reviews and user reviews on IMDB varied. These results were then to be stored inside the contents of the experiment tool (in an excel spreadsheet format). My hypothesis was that critic reviews would be able to predict the success of a movie less often than user reviews. Though this does not answer my full research question, it is the first stepping stone that I will need to answer. If this hypothesis was proven correct, then I would be able to prove that movie review data is an accurate way to predict the variability of movie success.  As this relates to my research question, it will also show me what other data would be relevant to the research question when I am ready to use the data analysis tools. The steps I took involved looking into more data scraping from other sources, as movie budget information was not available on IMDB. There was only one website that stored all the different movie budget data. I initially tried scraping the contents of the website, as I did earlier for my prototype tool. However, I ran into a permissions error that access to the website was forbidden. Upon further research, I realized that I was being blocked by the website because access to the data content needed to be accessed using their data platform, with all other attempts being blocked. I put in my request for access to the movie budget data, and was given a free trial access to the information for about 1,900 movies. Once I am able to start adding more data to my research, then I should be able to request access to a more extensive collection of movie data.

After I was able to run my experiment using different time frames, I was able to draw a conclusion about my results. The results of my experiment showed that there was consistent variability from the two reviews, especially when comparing between different generations. This could prove helpful when doing my analysis of the data, as I could potentially look into how this would affect generations and/or whether critics can accurately reflect the sentiments of a generation. I visualized the results of my findings using the matplotlib tool. This was able to show the variability between the two reviews in a visual way. My experiment results were then saved into the contents of the experimental tool as a png image. These visualizations could be used in my research project to show variability between different data points, which could aide in my demonstration and explanation of my full results. They could also be used to show future predictions made by my data analysis tool. I could also look into having different kinds of visuals for the possible use of sentiment analysis over social media.

Some ethical concerns that could be involved with my research deal with the potential use of sentiment analysis on social media, as the information gathered would be from private citizens. Though some of this type of ethical concern dealt with users actively allowing their content on social media to exist, thereby allowing researchers to use their 'public data', I do believe that there may be some changes to the current use of my data scraping tool. However, as the information is able to be accessed with a simple web search oftentimes, then I still think that it would be appropriate to use towards this type of analysis. If, however, the type of data gathered proves more harmful or does not provide a clear usefulness to my data, then I would approach my assigned first reader and other personnel on campus to look into the ethicalness of the situation. This will ensure that I am not running into ethical problems that could up hand the research that I have set out to do. Now that I have access to the data I need, the next steps that I see for my project would be to start looking into how to use data analysis tools so that I can start running experiments on the data.
