#### Questions

Please anticipate at least 500 words for this writing assignment.

Please address the following prompts to demonstrate the feasibility of your research project idea.

1. Hardware: What hardware equipment is necessary to run this project? Include computer specifications or access to a cloud service.

To run my project, a user would have to have a computer and/or a data set. For the computer, it should not matter what the specifications are, just as long as it is able to download an exe script or application. Since I am hoping that the final deliverable for my data mining software to be an application or a plugin to an existing application, then this should be able to be run by the majority of machines and operating systems.

2. Tools: What software, libraries, and similar do you need to complete your project? Provide at least three examples of resources (software tools, programming languages, libraries, etc.) you will use to complete your project.

Potential software that one would have to install is the original data mining software that I end up using. For instance, if I decide to continue with WEKA, then a user would have to install WEKA, in addition to my WEKA plugin, so that they can have the right environmental setup. If my plugin requires additional environment variables, it will probably be the Python programming language, the Java programming language, and potentially any outside libraries that I would import for the plugin. I might try utilizing poetry's dependency installation to manage this, which means users would only have to download the correct version of Python instead.

3. Skills: How do the skills that you possess contribute to the completion of your proposed project? Discuss your knowledge of programming languages you might use, familiarity with libraries, ability to install software, your proven record of learning new technical skills, etc.

I have an extensive knowledge of the Python and Java programming language, as these are the languages that I did the most projects with. Given the simplicity of the Python language, I am expecting to have more of the implementation written in this one. I also have familiarity with downloading and using Python packages, as well as how to utilize poetry for the installation of multiple packages and Python dependencies. I have a good enough track record with the installation of new software, where I am able to do some research into the different uses and 'how to' guides. As for my technical skills, I feel that I have the right amount of expertise to be able to handle the programming of the data mining tool and the mathematical technical skills needed. I might have to look into the potential use of A.I. in the software, which is not something that I have any experience in.

4. Data: Does your project require the use of existing data? If so, what data will you need, where will you obtain this data, how much can you obtain, how much is sufficient to use in your proposed project? If you plan to generate data, discuss how you will do so, where you will store the data, and how you will ensure its security.

If I do decide to make software that will be able to analyze data in a non-traditional format, then I might have to use existing data. Any data that is put in a format that is not currently accepted by data mining tools will be fine, as all I would want to do is add something to the tool that would allow it to accept a broader range of file formatting. I would only want to obtain a couple of these files of data, as they will primarily be used to test rather than anything else. I am not sure where I will obtain this data, but I am planning on looking into it. The other way I could go about this project is with generating data using multiple data mining tools to test the efficiency and accuracy of the different tools. I will be conducting my own study, providing me with raw data that I can then use with different data mining software. This will potentially lead me to different results and analytical means. I am planning on storing this data either on my personal machine or on an encrypted data cloud online. This will ensure that professional security is being maintained.

5. Time: How long do you anticipate for this project to take? How long will each part of the project take to complete? Remember that you will only have 2-3 months for the implementation of your project.

Given that the computer-related part of this project will be at a point where my data collection is done, then I would only expect about 3 months to completely finish the implementation. The research on data mining software and the specialization they have with different algorithms will probably take me a couple of weeks. The work on writing the code that would either accept more formats for files or to run through the testing of different algorithms would probably take me about a month or so. The interpretation of the results from my testing and the empirical analysis given by the software would take me about a couple of weeks. I am planning on updating the written portion of my comp all throughout, to ensure that important information is not lost at the end.

6. Results: What do successful results look like? How will you test your project for both correctness and efficiency?

Successful results will depend on the specific topic that I want. If I want to analyze different data mining software, successful results will tell me the best software to use for specific type of analyzing. That way other researchers could pick a tool based on what they would want to analyze. I will be testing this for correctness and efficiency by running tests with multiple sets of data. If I extend off of existing software to create code that would accept different file formats, successful results would be the ability to run the data mining software with the file format that I specified (ergo, 'non-traditional' format). I will test the functions in my code for correctness and to make sure that I making it as efficient as I can.

7. Analysis: How will you analyze the results? What approach will you use in the analysis? What experiments will you run to demonstrate your project and obtain results for analysis?

I am not completely sure what other tool I would use to analyze the results from the data mining software. If the results printed are simplistic (ergo, only analyzing with software scored higher on a predetermined checklist), then I would be able to manually analyze them. I will look to see which software tool marked higher during the analysis of a certain algorithm, and then come up conclusions about this. I will run the different software tools with varying data sizes which are analyzing different things.

8. Other abilities and resources: What else do you need for this project? Is there anything else that you may need to use or implement at some point to make this project successful? What is your back-up plan if your original project process fails?

I am not sure what else I will need for this project. I am assuming the need for outside resources and abilities will arise am I am working on it. My back-up plan is to reassess and modify the research idea needed for the project.

9. Threats to Validity: What might invalidate your reported results? For example, are there any assumptions you made in your experimental design, is the data set you plan to use large enough, are you relying on someone else's work that may contain mistakes, is your research process reproducible?

I am assuming that the data mining software can provide a correct analysis of data sets, which would affect the validity of the results. I am not sure if the data set is large enough, which could potentially affect the validity of the results given by the software. I might also look into getting other data sets, produced by different authors, which could potentially contain some mistakes.
