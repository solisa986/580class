### Research Interest

For my overall research idea, I would like to perform a study with a large data set, utilize a software to analyze the given data and generate visuals, and then attach those findings to the end of my study. I will then 'verify' the legitimacy of the program by doing manual computations. For the purposes of this class, I am looking into software and data mining tools that one could implement for statistical analysis. As of now, I have focused my research into WEKA, a software tool that uses machine learning algorithms as well as data mining tools to sort through and analyze large data sets. It can also generate visuals from the significant data as needed. Though this is something that I would ideally like to use for my Senior Thesis, I am also looking into the possibility of writing my own software with a similar operating structure. The reason that I am hesitant to utilize this software is because the source code is primarily written in Java, of which I am not that familiar. As this would be a massive undertaking on my part, I am also beginning to look into one of two other options. The first being whether I can modify the Java code in Python without any errors (not very likely given that these are two vastly different languages), or I could go back to the drawing board and try to find another software like WEKA that is written in Python. The reason that I would prefer this to be written in Python is because I would like the option to modify parts of the software as needed for a more custom data mining tool.
