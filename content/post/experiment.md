Does the preliminary critic review of a movie, when compared with public reviews, accurately predict the overall success or failure of the movie?

The experimental findings that will answer my research question are the metascore, the average rating, the budget, and the box office earnings for a movie. These will be used to determine the overall rating of the movie and compare it with the overall 'earnings' made from the movie. If the two fall within a certain range, then the experiment will 'fail', as the critic review was able to accurately predict the success of a movie. If it does not fall within this range, then the experiment will 'pass'. The data produced by my experiment will be a list of movies that were successful according to their 'earnings', but were predicted to fail based on preliminary ratings.

The execution of my experiment involved running my analysis of the two different reviews within 2 different years. This allowed me to analyze the results by generation, by decade, and by year. Some challenges I encounered were in regard to the visuals generated, but I was able to find out how to show the results in a graph.

The results obtained in my experience were a series of 3 graphs and a list of successful movies. The first graph showed how the ratings averaged for the list of movies, the second one showed how the metascore averaged for the list of movies, and the third graph was a comparison between the two. The list of movies were able to show me how many instances the metacritic rating was 'successful' towards a movie. Through the graphs, I learned that the variability between the metascore and the IMDB reviews rarely showed minimal differences, as most graphs showed a lot of variability between the two. Throuhg the list of movies, I was able to make distinctions about a movie (at least the ones I knew of) that could help me with the analysis of future iterations of this experiment. This means that I am able to gather more information about how a critic review relates to the success of a movie.
