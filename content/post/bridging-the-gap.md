## Summary

The current knowledge gap that I am seeing in my research is the question of whether the analysis provided by data mining tools be trusted and if different data mining tools influenced the unique outcomes found in an analysis. Though many different articles I have explored utilize data mining in some way, there is still a question on the accuracy of the results from data mining and/or the performance of different data mining techniques on data analysis. Therefore, I have decided to work on closing this knowledge gap by looking into whether there is an add-on to existing data mining tools that I can make so that traditional data can be used with these tools. I am also potentially interested in looking into whether the dependencies, languages, and/or the environment for the data mining tools influence the results being generated and/or their accuracy on predicting the nature of the data set.

#### Detailed Responses

1. Summarize the knowledge gap that emerges from your chosen research area.

The current knowledge gap that I am seeing in my research is the question of whether the analysis provided by data mining tools be trusted and if different data mining tools influenced the unique outcomes found in an analysis. Though this gap is vast and would provide a lot of research into the different kind of data mining tools, it is still fascinating to look into given that my entire study could be done on a computer-science related study. This would greatly help me with narrowing down my research areas and trying to find a topic for my comp.

2. State and introduce at least one research question that, when answered, will fill the knowledge gap.

One potential research question could be: Do the dependencies and/or languages of a data mining tool influence the accuracy of their results? Another potential one could be: Can data mining tools be adapted to implement the analysis of traditional data-sets?

3. Broadly, describe the steps that you will take to answer the research question(s), and fill the knowledge gap.

For either research question, I would have to research and finalize the list of data mining tools that I would want to implement in my testing. Once I finalize this list, I will have to either look into what I would want to test each tool on or on how I would be able to format traditional data so that it can be used for data mining. This will give me all of the basic information that I would need to get started on filling the knowledge gap provided in this sector of research.

### Reference Articles

How do you know that a gap exists? How does relevant literature motivate or provide justification to the completion of the gap? Identify at least four research articles or other materials which identify the gap. Please include four references in this discussion. Note: it is entirely likely that new references may need to be discovered for this discussion.

I know that the gap exists because, of all the research papers I've looked into, none of them utilize the same data mining tool for their analysis. Additionally, most economics studies end by suggesting the implementation of data mining tools for economic analysis. Considering that this is a very broad subject in the field of Economics, this gap could be closed by any number of ideas. The relevant literature provides justification for the completion of the gap because more economists would be open to using data mining tools if there were a study done on the analysis provided by data mining tools and/or whether the use of multiple tools would hinder or approve upon the accuracy of these insights. Four research articles that identify this gap:
  1. Hanna, M. (2004). Data mining in the e‚Äêlearning domain. Campus-wide information systems.
    - In this article, the main focus of it was on outlining the positive outcomes of utilizing data mining in e-learning systems. Though there were no data mining tools used, it was expressed that the implementation of these tools into economic analysis will help find significant data that is 'hidden' in a pile of data. This is an example of the gap between my idea of data analysis using data mining tools and the natural use of it in economic studies/aspects.
  2. Baicoianu, A., & Dumitrescu, S. (2010). Data mining meets economic Analysis: Opportunities and Challenges. Bulletin of the Transilvania University of Brasov. Economic Sciences. Series V, 3, 185.
    - In this article, the actual use of a data mining tool for economic analysis has been used for economic analysis, with the gap shifting now towards the exploration of different data mining techniques and/or the use of a different tools. Though this paper does provide more in-depth information about data mining techniques and the positive impact it has for predictions to the financial market, it still ends on the question for the future of data mining in financial analysis. More specifically, on how we could potentially use different data mining tools/techniques to improve upon the unbalanced frequencies of financial data, the speed of analysis, the performance, and the use of hybrid systems with multiple data mining techniques.
  3. Kaur, P., Singh, M., & Josan, G. S. (2015). Classification and prediction based data mining algorithms to predict slow learners in education sector. Procedia Computer Science, 57, 500-508.
    - In this article, the inclusion of data mining techniques is streamlining the different analysis's needed for a study. In this case, different classification techniques were used to predict slow learners in the education sector. As different classifiers were used, this study was able to identify which one provided the best accuracy overall, which shows the improvement of data mining tools in this sector. This analysis was done with the WEKA experimenter, which analyzed the performance of each classifier. This will allow the researchers to identify slow learners. This article further closes the gap on my data mining research, as it introduces the implementation of the combination of different data mining techniques and tools, as well as using data mining to test the accuracy of the results generated. This leads me towards a specific idea for my research project, which is finding a way to test different data mining tools, potentially determining whether the language/dependencies effect the accuracy of the tool.
  4. Yan, H., Yang, N., Peng, Y., & Ren, Y. (2020). Data mining in the construction industry: Present status, opportunities, and future trends. Automation in Construction, 119, 103331.
    - In this article, it is noted that the concepts and techniques for data mining have since been explored in different fields of analysis. However, what is still lacking in the research of data mining are in what it can do in future directions. For example, most data that is useful for analyzing human behavior is not able to be accessed by researches due to confidentiality, so the use of Data perturbation could be useful towards improving on the results generated by data mining. Additionally, there is untapped need for data mining to occur on unstructured data, which means data that is formatted in a traditional way. This closes the gap between my chosen area of research and data mining as well, because it lets me see whether I could look into the possibility of adding on a feature on existing data mining tools to allow for traditional data to be analyzed.
